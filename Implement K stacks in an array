// stack numbers will be 0 to k-1 for k stacks

// naive solution
// divide the stack into k parts
// problem - there might occur stack overflow

// better solution
// tricky solution
// we use an array of tops to store K tops.
// we use an additional array called next array.
// next array serves us two purposes 

( didnt understand solution much )
