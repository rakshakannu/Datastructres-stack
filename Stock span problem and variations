// span of an element - count of stocks that are smaller or same to that element
ar - [13,23,45]
span of 45 = 3

if for that element, if the just left value is greater, then span = 1
and span of first element in array = 1

if array in increasing order, span = 1,2,3,4,... for respective elements
if array in decreasing order, span = 1,1,1,1,... for respective elemnets

// naive solution
// travel to the left of every element with initialising span = 1

for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
  int span =1;
  for(int j=i-1; j>=0 ;j--)
  {
    if(arr[j]<=arr[i])
      span++;
    else
      break;
  }
  
  System.out.print(Span+" "); // span of all the elements will be printed
}

// better solution
// using stacks
// stacks helps to keep track of recent elements

( didnt understand solution)
